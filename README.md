# MCMC in R and Notes

This is a collection of notes and simple R-code for various Gibbs samplers and other MCMC algorithms. Mainly indented for demonstration and pedagogical purposes. 

* Factor Analysis Model as in Greenberg 2008
* Finite Mixture of Linear Regression Models as in Fr√ºhwirth-Schnatter (2006)
* Linear Regression Model (via Gibbs, HM and ABC MCMC) 
* Probit Regression Model as in Albert/Chib (1993) and Imai/van Dyk (2005) with Marginal Likelihood using Chib (1995)
* Probit Regression Model with Varying Intercept
